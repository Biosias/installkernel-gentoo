# kernel-install insists on using the EFI partition as BOOT_ROOT. And ignores
# the variable if it does not point to the root of a FAT partition.
# This is what we want for systemd-boot, but it is definitely not what we want
# for GRUB. grub-install (by default) installs a grub efi executable that
# always loads /boot/grub/grub.cfg, this will break if the BOOT_ROOT is not
# /boot which may be the case if the ESP is not mounted there.
#
# Instead ignore what kernel-install tells us, and mirror what the -systemd
# variant of this plugin does and always install to /boot
