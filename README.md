# installkernel-gentoo

Install the kernel on a Gentoo Linux system.

This script is called by the kernel's "make install" if it is installed as
/sbin/installkernel. It is also called by kernel-install.eclass.

This script was extracted from debianutils.  It was subsequenly modified
for Gentoo by Michał Górny and Andrew Ammerlaan.
